/**
@defgroup img_hash Provide algorithms to extract the hash of images and fast way to figure out most similar images in huge data set

Namespace for all functions is **img_hash**. The module brings implementations of different image hashing.

  @{
    @defgroup avg_hash Simple and fast perceptual hash algorithm

    This is a fast image hashing algorithm, but only work on simple case.For more details, please
    refer to http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html

    @defgroup p_hash Slower than average_hash, but tolerant of minor modifications

    This algorithm can combat more variation than averageHash, for more details please refer to
    http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html

    @defgroup marr_hash Marr-Hildreth Operator Based Hash, slowest but more discriminative
    http://www.phash.org/docs/pubs/thesis_zauner.pdf

    @defgroup radial_var_hash Image hash based on Radon transform.
    http://www.phash.org/docs/pubs/thesis_zauner.pdf

    @defgroup block_mean_hash Image hash based on block mean.
    http://www.phash.org/docs/pubs/thesis_zauner.pdf

    @defgroup color_moment_hash Image hash based on color moments.
